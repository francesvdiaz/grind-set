# My First Webpage
#### By *Frances Ojeda-Diaz*
#### Grindcore House Show Flyer!

## Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Description:
I made a flyer into a website with the idea of it being interactive in the future. I added links to my email and provided my venmo as well. In the future I'd like to use javascript to make flyer websites fully interactable and excessively loaded with content. Its like an underground e-vite.

There are no specific requirements besides saving the HTML file to your computer and opening it from your files application to view my webpage.

## Known Bugs:
There are currently no known bugs, phew.
